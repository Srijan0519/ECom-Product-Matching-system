ISOMETRIC -¬†Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC‚Ñ¢ design increases the sweet spot by 7%*.Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC‚Ñ¢ racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.ISOMETRIC‚Ñ¢ technology delivers greater control without sacrificing power.
LINER TECH¬†(For Improved Power And Comfort) -¬†Straight hole grommets elongate the strings to optimize power and comfort on off-center shots.
O.P.S (Oval Pressed Shaft) -¬†First introduced in 1969 with the T-7000 - our first aluminum tennis racquet - the Oval Pressed Shaft (OPS) is still incorporated into our most popular racquet series today.The Oval Pressed Shaft is designed to give players more spin, control, and feel. The shaft flexes at impact, increasing dwell time and minimizing vibrations.
Vibration Dampening Mesh (VDM) -¬†First used in our snowboards to reduce vibrations at impact, Vibration Dampening Mesh (VDM) is now used in four of our racquet series. VDM is a stretchy mesh material that is wrapped around the graphite within the grip to filter unwanted vibrations and improve touch and precision.
2G-Namd Speed -¬†A high modulus graphite fibers are bound with a carbon nanotube (CNT) structure, reducing energy loss, which enables to transfer the energy into quick snapback.
Namd is technology developed by Nitta Co., Ltd. to uniformly disperse carbon nanotubes in carbon fiber composites.
AERO SHAPE DESIGN -¬†An inverted frame design with a thinner frame face results in a softer racquet.

In line with the most popular racket Astrox 100 ZZ, this racket is launched with enhanced performance. has a medium flexible shaft and is therefore very suitable for most players, from recreational player to competition player. With the new innovations and materials used, these rackets are even more suitable for the evolving, fast-paced game of badminton.
By applying new technologies in different areas, this racket is revolutionary and the game becomes even faster. For example, this Astrox 100 Game has a slightly changed frame. The shape of the racket has become slightly squarer, so that the sweet spot has become slightly larger, but the racket still retains the same total frame size.

The shape of the cap is adapted to the shape of the thumb, so that even more power can be given to the racket.

The popular ASTROX 99 series known for generating dominating smash power, is coming out with new technology and a new look ‚Äï in collaboration with men's singles World No 1. Kento Momota. The new ASTROX 99 Pro goes a step beyond unequivocal raw power, gaining the ability to control the pace of the game.
The ASTROX 99 Pro is a head-heavy power racket, boasting the heaviest swing weight of the ASTROX series. It is known to generate a single, powerful smash, often too heavy to be speedy in recovery. In response, Yonex worked hand in hand with Kento Momota to craft a racket that would give him both power and the ability to convert defensive plays into offense; the result is an improved ASTROX 99 Pro where decisive power is accompanied by extended shuttle hold for enhanced defensive shot-making.

Power Assist Bumper
The new ASTROX 99 Pro is equipped with the POWER-ASSIST BUMPER, a tungsten-infused weighted bumper installed at the top of the frame transferring additional weight to the shuttle for more powerful smashes. To enhance defensive shot-making, Wide Diameter Grommets are strategically placed on the frame sides, allowing strings to shift at impact for emphasized shuttle pocketing. The iconic ISOMETRIC frame has been modified by strengthening frame corners to adjust the shape and expand the sweet spot.

ROTATIONAL GENERATOR SYSTEM

Counterbalanced Weight Distribution
By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is distributed throughout the grip end, frame top and the joint for maximum control. The transition to the next shot can be performed smoothly, with rapid succession.
ENERGY BOOST CAP PLUS
Uniquely shaped cap which maximizes shaft performance.The front allows the shaft to flex, while the sides arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.
The ASTROX series are distinguished by the¬†Rotational Generator System, our intricate weight distribution technology designed with the counterbalance theory that allows head-heavy racquets to recover faster between shots. By employing the VOLUME CUT RESIN, the new 88 S/D models have a further refined Rotational Generator System where intricate weight distribution can be taken to the next level.
Improvements¬†from the¬†VOLUME CUT RESIN¬†can also be seen in the frame and grommets. The frame structure is evolved with a larger sweet spot made possible by the strength-reinforced Isometric head shape. The grommets are improved with a new pattern that uses larger, strategically-placed grommets, a technology that allows more string movement at impact and ultimately increasing shuttle hold for assertive shot-making. The 88 S models, designed for front-court players, will have longer shuttle hold for precise net control and the 88 D models, designed for back-court players, will balance repulsion and shuttle hold for maximum power.",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0099/8224/6993/products/pro2.png?v=1632832215,null,"{""83 Grams"",Astrox,""Badminton Racquets"",""Customize Badminton String"",G5,Professional,Unstrung,""Upto 28 Lbs""}",06-01-2023,23-03-2023,11485,NULL,yonex,FALSE,yonex_astrox_88s_pro_unstrung_badminton_racquetblue

POWER CUSHION +
By adding a special elastic resin to POWER CUSHION, while maintaining the conventional lightweight properties, high shock absorption is realized. Grooves designed in a lattice pattern, with optimum spacing and depth, achieve further resilience.
Compared with conventional POWER CUSHION, the new POWER CUSHION Ôºã¬†boasts 25% more shock absorption and 12% more repulsion.
POWER CUSHION
The YONEX Power Cushion absorbs shock then reverses the impact energy for smooth transfer into the next movement.
Compared with urethane, the YONEX Power Cushion construction provides 3 times more shock absorbing power. When dropped from 7m above a Power Cushion sheet, an egg will bounce back 4m without damage.

TOE ASSIST SHAPE¬†

A toe-centric design that cuts down on pressure in the big toe, as well as offering improved support at the mid-foot and heel for a stable fit. Power loss is reduced, allowing for swift footwork.

SYNCHRO-FIT INSOLE¬†

YONEX Synchro-Fit Insole construction creates a secure contact between foot and shoe, reducing energy wastage through an improved fit.
ROUND SOLE¬†
The YONEX Round Sole is designed to provide all-around support for quick and smooth footwork. The Round Sole ensures smooth movements and transfer of maximum energy.
HEXAGRIP¬†
For agile and stable footwork, the hexagrip pattern provides 3% more grip and is 20% lighter than standard sole material.

ISOMETRIC

ISOMETRIC¬†technology continues to help the world‚Äôs greatest players achieve global success. Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC¬†design increases the sweet spot by 7%*. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC¬†racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings. ISOMETRIC¬†delivers greater control without sacrificing power.
TRI-VOLTAGE SYSTEM

Traditionally, extra weight at the top of the racquet frame has increased hitting power but reduced the speed of racquet handling. In contrast, a lighter top to the frame increases speed but causes a loss of hitting power. For the first time, the new TRI-VOLTAGE SYSTEM successfully combines the contrasting characteristics of exceptional power and great handling. YONEX has developed a racquet which achieves the combination of heavy smashes and speedy racquet handling. Voltric is Power: The stiff racquet structure at the top of the frame allows the head to bend in a very controlled way and hold shuttles on the string bed for longer. The thin frame sides then allow the frame to flex more and transfer more energy to the shuttle. This combination allows you to smash with instant power. Voltric is Agility: In VOLTRIC, the weight is balanced on the top of the frame and at the joint area which allows good handling while also maintaining power. The thin sides of the frame and at the top of the head reduce air resistance and improve the handling even further. Players can now make a full swing even during short range rallies as VOLTRIC responds instantly to even subtle movements.¬†

The use of multilayered Mesophase pitch-based Carbon Fibre increases the tensile strength and the durability of the racket. This ensures the long service-life of the racket.











STABILIZED ELASTIC SHAFT


Aramid fiber is a material with high strength, modulus, elasticity and toughness. It is used extensively in body armor and helmets. The shaft of the racket is filled with Aramid Fiber to absorb vibrations and shocks without sacrificing flexibility, thereby reducing and avoiding sports injury.











CUBIC LOCKING


Cubic grommets on the head of the racket are locked within a slim groove. This provides an improvement in the control and shock absorption of the racket, while also protecting the longevity of the string.

Experience the power to breakthrough new limits with a unique flexible frame structure at 5' and 7 O' clock positions to absorb potential rebound energy, doubling the acceleration power of the racket in return. With the 'Thunderbolt Cloud' Technology and T1100G High Modulus carbon-fibre frame, the racket's overall stability is improved by suppressing turbulence and improving striking precision. The Energy Absorption Rebound Technology also enhances the racket's rebound speed and increases shuttlecock acceleration by 3.2% (Li-Ning lab data).
This is an INSTINCT Series racket featuring a light head and a flexible shaft which allows quick movement of the racket in the desired direction. This series is a perfect match for players who prefer lightweight rackets and want to inject swiftness and speed in both shots and movement.






TECTONIC ENERGY RETURN PLATFORM


Tectonic series rackets are designed with a unique flexible Tectonic frame structure at the 5 &amp; 7 o'clock positions, which provide additional energy return in every stroke.











MPCF REINFORCEMENT


The use of multilayered Mesophase pitch-based Carbon Fibre increases the tensile strength and the durability of the racket. This ensures the long service-life of the racket.











STABILIZED ELASTIC SHAFT


Aramid fiber is a material with high strength, modulus, elasticity and toughness. It is used extensively in body armor and helmets. The shaft of the racket is filled with Aramid Fiber to absorb vibrations and shocks without sacrificing flexibility, thereby reducing and avoiding sports injury.











CUBIC LOCKING


Cubic grommets on the head of the racket are locked within a slim groove. This provides an improvement in the control and shock absorption of the racket, while also protecting the longevity of the string.

Its Head-Light¬†weight distribution is complemented with its high tension rating and medium-flexible shaft, which improves your power generation capability, giving you a well-balanced racket with Agility and Power.

POWERED BY WINDSTORM


We re-engineered the Windstorm technology platform, to design the Wind Lite series of rackets. This gives Wind Lite the extremely lightweight class of the Windstorm rackets, with additional power generation capability with its Medium-Flex Shaft.

HIGH TENSION


With the use of our unique TB Nano Carbon Fiber, we were able to engineer an extremely light frame without sacrificing it's tension rating. This allows you to string your Wind Lite Rackets at up to 30 Pounds.

AEROTEC BEAM SYSTEM


The Aerotec Beam System is an extra aero-dynamic frame structure that is specially engineered to minimize air resistance while maintaining the strength of the frame.

The Shadow Spirit has been designed for intense playing. In addition to being more comfortable, it has all the qualities required for optimal moves and stances, without friction or damage. It perfectly meets the needs of long training sessions and repeated matches. Nothing will stop you.
""MOVE AND POSITION YOURSELF WITH AGILITY
You can only take the advantage if you are responsive and precise in your stances and moves. The Michelin and Babolat engineering teams have collaborated for long months to develop a special sole with remarkable performance: a three-dimensional grip, combined with a unique rubber formula, guarantees explosive movements and controlled sudden stops, without compromising on durability.
¬†CUSHION AND PROTECT
The heel, which endures heavy strain, is protected by a bi-density sole that absorbs shocks and at the same time helps you rebound. The shoe's structure has been designed to support the foot for any type of stance; the upper material moulds the foot's shape, while preventing the foot from moving inside the shoe. Play in total safety.
¬†PERFORMANCE WITHOUT COMPROMISING ON COMFORT
Discomfort must not ruin the pleasure of the game and the desire to win. The Shadow Tour is comfortable, even after several hours of playing: the soft tongue and high collar surround the foot without being too tight, the anti-bacterial moulded inner sole hugs the shape of the foot and prevents odours and the upper material allows your foot to breathe.",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0099/8224/6993/products/T1_bb43e9c1-eefb-44f0-8b69-93ec41b791a3.jpg?v=1667462853,null,"{""Badminton Shoe"",""badminton shoes""}",06-01-2023,23-03-2023,5249,NULL,babolat,FALSE,babolat_shadow_spirit_men_badminton_shoes

ABSORPTION

This is our best-selling replacement grip as one of the most absorbent within our range. But if you sweat a lot when you play, you should definitely use an over grip on top of it, for even higher moisture absorption.
FEEL

With its 1.9mm thickness, we designed a grip to provide you with a very balanced feel, something not too direct and not too comfy either. With the Syntec Pro, you will have a greater control of your racquet thanks to its tacky feel improving the traction.

The EVO Drive brings easy power and comfort to your game.
EASY POWER

You told us you need power to support your game, so we made this racquet even better for you and developed a new concept we called effortless power. Thanks to its new lay-up, brand new 16/17 string pattern and its 104 sq. in. headsize, we guarantee you it has never been that easy to make a powerful stroke.
COMFORT

You can‚Äôt stand vibrations in your arm or an unpleasant sound when you hit the ball? Problem solved! We want you to experience this new softer feel on every shot this racquet provides thanks to its SWX EVO Feel technology, a thin layer of high damping viscoelastic material that absorbs vibrations and shock at impact.
FORGIVENESS

Come on! Admit this is sometimes frustrating to hit the ball with the frame of your racquet. What you need is just a bit more space between your strings and a larger racquet head.
ELLIPTIC FRAME
Elliptical frame structure with optimal resistance and overall rigidity for phenomenal power.
WOOFER SYSTEM
The first and most effective frame-string interaction system that provides a longer ball and string contact time for greater control and comfort.
