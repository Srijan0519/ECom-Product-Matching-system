### Note:

Some files were too large for git upload even after zipping. They are not uploaded on this repository but can be accessed through this [link](https://packtservices-my.sharepoint.com/personal/srijan_packt_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fsrijan%5Fpackt%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2Ftitle%2Dmatching&view=0). If you are not a Packt member, you will need to send a permission request.

  ## How to Use?
  - Clone the repository
  - Make sure you have all the requirements in your system. Else create a requirements.txt file that contains pickle, transformers, os, pandas, torch, fuzzywuzzy. Run this txt file using pip.
  - Download the pickle file and run only the demo.py file
  - Also make sure you update the filepath.

Trust the process, reach out to me for any problems.
